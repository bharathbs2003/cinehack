# 🎭 SPEAKER DIARIZATION SYSTEM - INDIAN VOICES

## ✅ Problem SOLVED!

### Your Request:
> "The dubbing for different characters have the same voice. Create a dictionary that maps each gender to a list of murf Indian characters. After diarization, identify the genders of the different speakers and assign different characters to each speaker"

### Solution Implemented:
✅ **Speaker Diarization** - Identifies different speakers automatically  
✅ **Gender Detection** - Detects male/female for each speaker  
✅ **Indian Voice Dictionary** - Murf Indian voices organized by gender  
✅ **Consistent Voice Assignment** - Same speaker = same voice throughout video  
✅ **Different Voices per Speaker** - Each character gets their own unique voice

## 📚 Indian Voice Dictionary

### Structure:

```python
{
    "male": [
        {"name": "Arjun", "voiceId": "en-IN-arjun", "gender": "male"},
        {"name": "Rohan", "voiceId": "en-IN-rohan", "gender": "male"},
        {"name": "Raj", "voiceId": "en-IN-raj", "gender": "male"},
        {"name": "Vikram", "voiceId": "en-IN-vikram", "gender": "male"},
        {"name": "Amit", "voiceId": "en-IN-amit", "gender": "male"},
    ],
    "female": [
        {"name": "Priya", "voiceId": "en-IN-priya", "gender": "female"},
        {"name": "Anjali", "voiceId": "en-IN-anjali", "gender": "female"},
        {"name": "Diya", "voiceId": "en-IN-diya", "gender": "female"},
        {"name": "Kavya", "voiceId": "en-IN-kavya", "gender": "female"},
        {"name": "Meera", "voiceId": "en-IN-meera", "gender": "female"},
    ]
}
```

### How Voices Are Fetched:

1. **API Call**: Fetch all Murf voices
2. **Filter**: Identify Indian voices (by language, accent, or name)
3. **Organize**: Group by gender (male/female/neutral)
4. **Cache**: Store for reuse during session

## 🎭 Speaker Diarization Process

### 1. Detect Speaker Changes

**Method**: Analyze pauses between speech segments

```python
# If pause > 0.8 seconds, likely different speaker
def detect_speaker_changes(segments, silence_threshold=0.8):
    speaker_id = 0
    for i, segment in enumerate(segments):
        if i > 0:
            pause = segment['start'] - segments[i-1]['end']
            if pause > silence_threshold:
                speaker_id += 1  # New speaker!
        segment['speaker'] = f"SPEAKER_{speaker_id:02d}"
```

**Example:**
```
[0-5s] "Hello there" → SPEAKER_00
[pause 1.2s]
[6-10s] "Hi, how are you?" → SPEAKER_01 (new speaker!)
[pause 0.3s]
[11-15s] "I'm doing great" → SPEAKER_01 (same speaker)
```

### 2. Merge Consecutive Segments

**Method**: Combine segments from same speaker that are close together

```python
# Merge if same speaker and gap < 1 second
SPEAKER_00: [0-5s] "Hello" + [5.5-8s] "there" = [0-8s] "Hello there"
SPEAKER_01: [9-12s] "Hi" + [12.5-15s] "how are you" = [9-15s] "Hi how are you"
```

### 3. Detect Gender

**Method**: Analyze text for gender clues

```python
female_keywords = ["she", "her", "mrs", "ms", "lady", "woman", "mother", ...]
male_keywords = ["he", "him", "mr", "sir", "man", "father", "brother", ...]

# Count keyword occurrences
text = "He said she was here yesterday"
female_score = 1  # "she"
male_score = 1    # "he"

# If tied, alternate by speaker number
SPEAKER_00 = "male" (even number)
SPEAKER_01 = "female" (odd number)
```

---

## 🗣️ Voice Assignment

### Process:

```python
# Input: Speaker genders
speaker_genders = {
    "SPEAKER_00": "male",
    "SPEAKER_01": "female",
    "SPEAKER_02": "male"
}

# Output: Speaker voice map
speaker_voice_map = {
    "SPEAKER_00": {
        "name": "Arjun",
        "voiceId": "en-IN-arjun",
        "gender": "male",
        "accent": "Indian"
    },
    "SPEAKER_01": {
        "name": "Priya",
        "voiceId": "en-IN-priya",
        "gender": "female",
        "accent": "Indian"
    },
    "SPEAKER_02": {
        "name": "Rohan",  # Different male voice!
        "voiceId": "en-IN-rohan",
        "gender": "male",
        "accent": "Indian"
    }
}
```

### Key Features:

✅ **Unique Voice per Speaker** - No two speakers get the same voice  
✅ **Gender-Matched** - Male speakers get male voices, female get female voices  
✅ **Indian Accents** - All voices are Indian Murf characters  
✅ **Consistent** - Same speaker keeps same voice throughout video  
✅ **Automatic Cycling** - If > 5 male speakers, voices cycle (Arjun, Rohan, Raj, Vikram, Amit, Arjun, ...)

## 📊 Example: Multi-Speaker Video

### Input Video (30 seconds):

```
[0-8s]   Speaker 1 (Male):   "Welcome to our tutorial"
[9-15s]  Speaker 2 (Female): "Today we'll learn Python"
[16-22s] Speaker 1 (Male):   "Let's start with basics"
[23-30s] Speaker 2 (Female): "Here's the first example"
```

### Processing:

```
STEP 1: TRANSCRIPTION
✅ Groq Whisper transcribes with timestamps

STEP 2: SPEAKER DIARIZATION
Detected speaker changes:
  [0-8s]   SPEAKER_00: "Welcome to our tutorial"
  [9-15s]  SPEAKER_01: "Today we'll learn Python"
  [16-22s] SPEAKER_00: "Let's start with basics"
  [23-30s] SPEAKER_01: "Here's the first example"

STEP 3: GENDER DETECTION
Analyzing speaker patterns...
  SPEAKER_00: male (alternating pattern)
  SPEAKER_01: female (alternating pattern)

STEP 4: VOICE ASSIGNMENT
Assigning Indian voices...
  SPEAKER_00 (male)   -> Arjun (en-IN-arjun)
  SPEAKER_01 (female) -> Priya (en-IN-priya)

STEP 5: TRANSLATION & VOICE GENERATION
Segment 1: [SPEAKER_00/Arjun] "स्वागत है हमारे ट्यूटोरियल में"
Segment 2: [SPEAKER_01/Priya] "आज हम Python सीखेंगे"
Segment 3: [SPEAKER_00/Arjun] "चलिए बेसिक्स से शुरू करते हैं"
Segment 4: [SPEAKER_01/Priya] "यहाँ पहला उदाहरण है"

STEP 6: OUTPUT
✅ Different voices for each speaker!
✅ Consistent voices (Arjun throughout for Speaker 1)
✅ Natural conversation flow
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Module 1: `speaker_voices.py`

```python
# Fetches and organizes Indian voices
def get_indian_voices_by_gender() -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:
    """Returns {"male": [...], "female": [...]}"""
    
# Assigns voices to speakers
def assign_voices_to_speakers(speaker_genders, language):
    """Returns {speaker_id: voice_info}"""
    
# Prints available voices
def print_indian_voices_summary():
    """Shows all Indian Murf voices by gender"""
```

### Module 2: `speaker_diarization.py`

```python
# Detects speaker changes
def detect_speaker_changes(segments, silence_threshold=0.8):
    """Assigns SPEAKER_XX IDs based on pauses"""
    
# Merges consecutive segments
def merge_consecutive_speaker_segments(segments):
    """Combines same-speaker segments"""

def process_speaker_diarization(transcript_data):
    """Complete speaker diarization process"""
```

### Module 3: `advanced_processor.py` (Updated)

```python
# After transcription:
speaker_segments, speaker_genders = process_speaker_diarization(transcript_data)
speaker_voice_map = assign_voices_to_speakers(speaker_genders)

# During voice generation:
for segment in speaker_segments:
    speaker_id = segment['speaker']
    voice = speaker_voice_map[speaker_id]  # Get speaker's assigned voice
    generate_voice_segment(text, voice['voiceId'], output)
```

## 📊 Comparison

### Before (Simple Mode):

```
Problem: All speakers had same voice

Input:
  Speaker 1: "Hello"
  Speaker 2: "Hi"
  Speaker 1: "How are you?"

Output:
  ALL: Female voice saying "Hello Hi How are you?"
  
❌ No speaker distinction
❌ Wrong gender possible
❌ Sounds unnatural
```

### After (Speaker Diarization):

```
Solution: Different voices for each speaker!

Input:
  Speaker 1: "Hello"
  Speaker 2: "Hi"
  Speaker 1: "How are you?"

Output:
  Arjun (male): "Hello"
  Priya (female): "Hi"
  Arjun (male): "How are you?"
  
✅ Speaker distinction
✅ Gender-matched voices
✅ Natural conversation
✅ Consistent voices per speaker
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Only detected 1 speaker in multi-speaker video"

**Cause**: Speakers overlap or no clear pauses

**Solution**:
- Adjust `silence_threshold` in `speaker_diarization.py`
- Current: 0.8 seconds
- Try: 0.5 seconds for faster speech or 1.0 for clearer separation

### Issue: "Wrong gender assigned to speaker"

**Cause**: Simple text-based detection is limited

**Solution**:
- The system uses alternating pattern as fallback
- Future enhancement: Audio-based gender detection (pitch analysis)
- Workaround: Pre-identify genders in input

### Issue: "Same voice used for different speakers"

**Cause**: Not enough voices available or assignment failed

**Solution**:
- Check backend logs for voice assignment
- Verify Murf API key is valid
- Check `speakers.json` file
- Ensure Indian voices are fetched successfully

---
