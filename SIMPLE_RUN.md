## ‚ö†Ô∏è Python 3.13 Compatibility Issue

You're running **Python 3.13.5** which has compatibility issues with some AI/ML packages.

## üéØ Two Options to Run

### Option 1: Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Download Python 3.11**: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31110/
2. **Install it** (alongside your current Python)
3. **Run with Python 3.11**:
   ```bash
   py -3.11 -m venv backend\venv
   backend\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Option 2: Simplified Version (Current Python)

I can create a simplified version that works with your existing system but without the advanced ML features temporarily.

**What will work:**
- ‚úÖ Web interface
- ‚úÖ Video upload
- ‚úÖ Basic transcription (OpenAI API)
- ‚úÖ Translation (OpenAI API)
- ‚úÖ Voice generation (Murf/ElevenLabs APIs)
- ‚úÖ Video processing

**What won't work (requires Python 3.10/3.11):**
- ‚ùå WhisperX (local transcription)
- ‚ùå Speaker diarization
- ‚ùå Emotion detection
- ‚ùå Lip-sync

## üí° Recommendation

**Install Python 3.11** for full functionality:

1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31110/
2. Download "Windows installer (64-bit)"
3. Run installer
4. Check "Add Python 3.11 to PATH"
5. Install

Then run:
```bash
py -3.11 -m venv backend\venv
backend\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will give you ALL features including:
- WhisperX transcription
- Speaker diarization  
- Emotion detection
- Lip-sync support

## üîÑ Or Continue with Simplified Version?

Would you like me to:
1. **Install Python 3.11** and continue? (RECOMMENDED)
2. **Create simplified version** for Python 3.13?

Let me know!
