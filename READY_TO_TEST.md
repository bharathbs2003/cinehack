## 🎬 HOW TO TEST VIDEO DUBBING

### Step 1: Open Application
```
http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Prepare Test Video
**Recommended for first test:**
- Length: 30-60 seconds
- Format: MP4, MOV, AVI

- Content: Clear speech (news clips, interviews work best)

### Step 3: Upload & Configure
1. Click "Choose File" and select your video
2. Select **Source Language** (language in the video)
3. Select **Target Language** (language to dub into)
4. Click **"Generate Dub"**

### Step 4: Watch Progress
You'll see real-time updates:
```
15% - Extracting audio from video (5 seconds)
30% - Transcribing speech with OpenAI Whisper (15-30 seconds)
50% - Translating text to target language (5 seconds)
70% - Generating new voice with Murf AI (20-40 seconds)
85% - Merging audio back to video (5 seconds)
100% - Done! Ready to download
```

### Step 5: Download Result
- Click **"Download Dubbed Video"** button

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Check Backend Logs
Look at the PowerShell window running the backend for detailed logs like:
```
[job_id] Extracting audio...
[job_id] Transcribing audio...
[job_id] ERROR: [specific error message]
```

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed to extract audio"**
- Ensure video file is not corrupted
- Try a different video format (MP4 recommended)

**2. "Transcription failed"**
- Check OpenAI API key has credits
- Verify audio has clear speech

**3. "Voice generation failed"**
- Check Murf API key is valid
- Ensure selected language is supported

**4. "Stuck at 0% queued"**
- Refresh the page
- Check backend logs for errors
- Restart backend if needed

### Manual Restart (if needed)
```powershell
# Stop backend
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*EduDubAI*"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Restart
cd D:\EduDubAI\backend
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.main_simple
```
